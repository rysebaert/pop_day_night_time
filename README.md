## Population over the day, the night, the seasons

The ENACT-POP R2020A dataset is a spatial raster dataset provided by JRC (Schiavina et al. (2020)). It depicts the seasonal nightime and daytime population in a 1km grid resolution for 2011. It covers EU28.

The GHSL - Global Human Settlement Layer proposes a data viewer to interactively explore the results, here. However, the tool is not especially suitable to :

- Compare monthes, daytime and nightime. The user must change the layer selected manually.
- Observe spatial trends outside the mosaic of grid cells.

We propose in this notebook a methodological framework for analysing the seasonal and daytime changes based on spatial interpolation method (Stewart (1942)), allowing to observe the phenomenon on a continuous surface from a set of discrete points.
